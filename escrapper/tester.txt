               INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

               Peter, Lois, Chris, Meg, Brian, and Stewie walk into the
               exquisite movie theater.  They have just ordered their
               tickets for the movie.

                                   USHER
                         Here are your tickets.  Enjoy your
                         movie.

                                   LOIS
                         Ok, kids, you guys go and save us a
                         seat while we get the food.
                             (beat)
                         Oh, Peter.  It sure is nice to go
                         out and do something as a family
                         again.

                                   PETER
                         Yeah.  We haven't been to the
                         movies in a long time.

                                   BRIAN
                         It's no wonder.  You remember the
                         last time we all went to the
                         movies?

               There's a silence and moment of motionlessness.

                                   PETER
                         Uh, yeah.  It seems like it was
                         only yesterday...

               Another silence.

                                   PETER
                         Ok, why isn't it showing the
                         flashback?

                                   LOIS
                         It's probably just a technical
                         error, Peter.  I'm sure they'll
                         have it working in no time.

               Silence.  Brian, Peter, and Lois wait for the flashback to
               come on.  Nothing.

                                   PETER
                         Damn this network.  Always screwing
                         up our lives. How the hell are we
                         going to tell our story if we can't
                         even have one flashback? 
                         This is just like the time I
                         started that petition to bring back
                         Butt Ugly Martians. There's no
                         flashback.

                                   PETER
                         That's it.  I quit... The opening
                         theme starts.

               INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

               Chris and Meg, who is carrying Stewie, are ordering some food
               for the movie.

                                   MEG
                         Yeah, can I get one large popcorn
                         with extra butter, two medium
                         cokes, and some Twizzlers?

               The employee behind the register puts a sign up on the
               counter.  It reads: NO DOGS ALLOWED.

                                   EMPLOYEE
                         Next!

               Meg frowns.  Stewie tries to cheer her up.

                                   STEWIE
                         Oh, don't frown upon your
                         hideousness, Meg.  I'm sure it
                         comes in quite useful when you need
                         to get out of a certain situation.

               Meg struggles to keep Stewie in her arms.

                                   MEG
                         Stewie, you're getting too heavy
                         for me to carry you anymore.

                                   STEWIE
                         Too heavy?  Now listen here, David
                         Lee Roth, I work out thirty minutes
                         a day while on a special diet
                         designed by Taebo fitness
                         instructor Billy Blanks.

                                   MEG
                         Stewie, you're gonna have to walk.

               She sets Stewie down.  Stewie jumps up and down, demanding to
               be picked back up and carried.

                                   STEWIE
                         Why, you fobbing flap-mouthed
                         lewdster!  Pick me back up!  I
                         refuse to walk on this mess you
                         call a floor.  Who knows what's
                         been on it!

               An old man walks by with muddy shoes.  The mud wipes onto the
               carpet.  Suddenly, the man trips on his own feet, and his
               face hits the floor hard.  His false teeth fly out of his
               mouth, transmitting gooey saliva all over the floor. Stewie
               gasps and becomes sickened. A passing woman gasps at the
               sight of the false teeth.

                                   WOMAN #1
                         Oh, that's disgusting!

               She immediately hurls up her lunch.  The vomit spreads across
               the floor, and another passing moviegoer slips in the puke. A
               young kid runs out of the bathroom with toilet paper attached
               to his shoe.

                                   STEWIE
                         Oh, God...

               Stewie faints.

                                                       CUT TO:

               INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

               Everyone is watching the movie.  The previews are playing.

               CLOSE ON

               THE FOLLOWING PREVIEW HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR ALL AUDIENCES BY
               AN ASSOCIATION WHO DESTROYS FILMS.

               A reptile of some sort is on the screen attacking people.

                                   PREVIEW VOICEOVER (O.S.)
                         They're fast... they're vicious...
                         they're completely inane... and
                         this summer, you have to put up
                         with them... again!

               The main title of the movie emerges on screen: ANACONDAS 3.

                         Starring Jean Stapleton as the sexy
                         scientist.

               JEAN appears on screen, looking old and unhealthy.

                                   JEAN STAPLETON
                         If we don't come up with an idea of
                         how these things got so big, WE'RE
                         ALL DEAD!

                         groundbreaking role ever as the
                         villainous boat passenger...

                                   CLIFF ROBERTSON
                         I'm here for no reason than to
                         complicate matters, and to chew
                         bubble gum.  And damn it, I'm all
                         out of bubble gum!

                         This is the film you have to see to
                         believe...

               The title appears again: ANACONDAS 3.

                                                           FADE OUT TO:

               INT. THEATER AUDIENCE

               Everyone in the theater is silent.

                                   PETER
                         I am so there.

               Stewie is on Lois's lap, fidgeting and fussing as he's
               terrified of the gross floor. Lois is becoming agitated as
               well.

                                   LOIS
                         Stewie, sit still.  You're
                         bothering Mommy.

                                   STEWIE
                         Lois, it's that damn floor!  It'll
                         kill us all, I tell you!  ALL OF
                         US!  It's a germ infested, noxious,
                         contaminated killing machine! 
                         DON'T LET IT GET ME!

               Stewie climbs on top of Lois's head.

                                   LOIS
                         That's it, Stewie!  I told you to
                         stop.

               She pulls Stewie off of her head and sets him on the floor.
               Stewie howls in fear and disgust as his feet stick to the
               floor like a magnet on a fridge.

                                   STEWIE
                         Lois, for God's sake!  Look, we can
                         forget about the times when I tried
                         to slaughter you, right?  Lois? 
                         WOMAN, SAVE MEEE!!!

               He falls over, and his face sticks to the floor like a
               cockroach in a Roach Motel.

                                   STEWIE
                         Stuck... stuck... STUCK!

               He tries to pull away, but his skin remains glued to the
               sticky floor. He begins to cry. People in the audience become
               irritated.

                                   AUDIENCE MEMBER #1
                         CAN YOU SHUT THAT BABY UP!?

                                   AUDIENCE MEMBER #2
                         WE'RE TRYING TO WATCH A MOVIE HERE!

               Lois leans over to Brian.

                                   LOIS
                         Brian, can you take Stewie out to
                         the lobby?

                                   BRIAN
                         Sure, Lois.

               Brian stands up and picks up Stewie.  Stewie's face peels off
               of the floor and stretches as Stewie finally stands
               completely.  Brian picks Stewie up and walks out of the
               theater with him, entering

               INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

               Stewie jumps onto a bench and quivers at the sight of the
               floor.

                                   BRIAN
                         Stewie, what's your problem?

                                   STEWIE
                         Brian!  Get off of the floor!

                                   BRIAN
                         What for?

                                   STEWIE
                         There's no time!  I'll save you!

               Stewie jumps off of the bench and tackles Brian to the floor,
               smashing a potted plant to pieces as the vase breaks into
               tiny fragments. Stewie lifts Brian up from his collar and
               pulls him onto the bench.  Stewie is out of breath and Brian
               is confused.

                                   BRIAN
                         Stewie, what the hell?

                                   STEWIE
                         We're safe here.  Not forever, but
                         for now.

                                   BRIAN
                         What were we not safe from to begin
                         with?

                                   STEWIE
                         I'll show you.

               Stewie leans over the bench and peers at the floor.

                                   STEWIE
                         There.  Just below us. Frightening,
                         isn't it?

                                   BRIAN
                         Stewie, are you talking about the
                         floor?

                                   STEWIE
                         NO!  What's ON the floor...!

                                   BRIAN
                         The carpet?

               A THEATER USHER approaches Brian and Stewie.  The one that
               turned Meg away.

                                   THEATER USHER
                         I'm sorry, sir, but there's no dogs
                         allowed in the theater.  And every
                         infant must have an adult with them
                         over the age of 18.

                                   BRIAN
                         Over 18?  I'm 49 years old!

                                   THEATER USHER
                         And human.

                                   BRIAN
                         You can't do that.  I'm a paying
                         customer.

                                   THEATER USHER
                         It's our policy, sir, and I can't
                         bend the rules to satisfy what you
                         think is right.

                                   BRIAN
                         Why, you...

               Brian lifts his fist. Suddenly, the floor begins shaking. 

               AN EARTHQUAKE! 

               The floor begins splitting and cracking.  The ceiling wilts
               and tarnishes as broken beams fall to the floor. A beam falls
               on the THEATER USHER, knocking him unconscious.

                                   BRIAN
                         OH MY GOD!  IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE!

               The movie playing on screen becomes loud as an action scene
               takes place. The movie theater begins to shake.  The aisles
               split in half and the ceiling caves in.  Everybody panics and
               runs for their lives. Lois grabs Chris and Meg's hands and
               pulls them to safety from a falling wooden beam.

                                   LOIS

                         ON!

               Peter remains seated. The earthquake suddenly subsides. 
               Everything goes quiet as the movie theater becomes empty,
               except for Peter. Silence.  Peter remains still.

                                   PETER
                         Wow.  The sound here is incredible.

                         A sudden and unexpected earthquake
                         struck Quahog just last night at
                         eight o'clock.  The first of its
                         kind since the early 1970's. 
                         Seismologists have yet to figure
                         out if there will be any other
                         seismic waves to cause another
                         earthquake in the area, but it's
                         safe to say that we're all lucky it
                         was only a 4.0 on the Richter
                         scale.

                         That's right, Tom.  The damage was
                         moderate, but thank God nobody was
                         seriously injured.

               The theater usher is still pinned under the broken beam that
               fell on him.  Beams and broken pieces of wood continue to
               fall in the background as a result of the earthquake.  The
               man under the beam reaches his hand up in pain, when a man in
               a dark cloak approaches him.

                                   DARK MAN
                         Darth Vader.  Rise.

               The man under the beam isn't the same.  He's now dressed in a
               slick outfit with a handsome black cape.  On his head is a
               dark helmet that projects his heavily breathing voice. 
               This is the familiar Darth Vader from the STAR WARS movies. A
               beam suddenly falls on him, again.  Darth Vader is no more.

                                   DARK MAN
                         Now where the hell am I going to
                         get someone to join the Dark
                         Side...?

               The Dark Man laughs an evil laughter. A beam falls on him,
               too.

                         Rhode Island are joyous to still be
                         living today.  As you can see, the

                         damage to businesses and stores on

                         feel when it happened?

                         Well I was having sex with some
                         chick, and the bed started shaking,
                         and I thought it was just some good
                         pushin', but then the whole ceiling
                         started caving in!

                         And how did you feel?

                                   QUAGMIRE
                         Well things went from hot to cold
                         pretty quick.  I finished up and
                         she left.

                                   TRISHA
                         Did you feel at all frightened

                         about two weeks, and we never
                         really thought about our age
                         difference.  It's the attraction
                         that matters.

               She holds Chris's right hand.

                         And I'm more attracted to him than
                         anybody else I've been with.

                         You're with Chris, but the
                         attraction is what matters?  Is
                         that what you said?  The attraction
                         is what's important?  And you're
                         with Chris?

                         Ok, just making sure.

                         Meg, when are you gonna find a
                         handsome boy at your school?  Maybe
                         that's the problem. 
                         You should try looking for a
                         boyfriend at Chris's school.  The
                         popular girls are doing it.

                                   MEG
                         Mom, you always told me to be my
                         own person.  I don't care what the
                         popular kids are doing!  I don't
                         like any of this!

               Meg flips over her plate against the wall and runs off
               crying.

                                   LOIS
                         Meg!  Get back here!

                         Don't worry, Lois.  I set a trap on
                         the stairs to stop her that's
                         impossible to fail.

               Meg runs up the stairs.  She sees a bear trap lying on one of
               the steps.  She jumps over it. 

               The stairs cave in.  Meg falls inside. 

               A piano rolls down the steps and falls inside the broken
               staircase hole.  The piano crushes Meg.

                         Peter, you paid the usher.  Any one
                         of us could have done that.

                         Yeah.  Uh huh.  Sure.  Maybe you
                         should look for a job and quit
                         being jealous, Brian.  You're
                         making yourself look bad.

               Brian throws his plate against the wall and walks off, angry
               that Peter would him degrade him in such a harsh way.

               Chris runs up to the television and takes a bite out of it.
               His teeth hit a wire, and it electrocutes him instantly.
               Chris's hair stands up as electricity spreads through his
               body.  Chris moans as he can't move his teeth, but they're
               biting down harder on the wires. 

               There's an explosion, and Chris is knocked back over the
               couch.  The couch falls on its back as Chris continues to

               Meg, Connie, and other students are sitting in science class.

               Connie is talking to her friends while Meg overhears their
               conversation.

                                   CONNIE'S FRIEND #1
                         So what's going on with you and
                         that 13 year old from the Junior
                         High?

                                   CONNIE
                         Ah, it's great.  Things are going
                         so well.  I still can't believe
                         it's working out.

               Meg smiles, happy that Connie is satisfied with Chris.

                                   CONNIE'S FRIEND #2
                         Ha.  I can't believe the fatso
                         thinks you really like him.

               Meg gasps and turns around.

                                   CONNIE
                         Yeah.  My ex boyfriend is already
                         jealous.  Ha, this is so cool.  I
                         never would have expected this plan
                         to work.

               Meg is furious.

               She jumps out of her chair and runs over to Connie.

                                   MEG
                         Connie Demico!  You're using my
                         brother to make your ex boyfriend
                         jealous?

                         I can't believe you would sink so
                         low!  He didn't do anything to you!

                         What's your problem, Meg?  It's not
                         like I'm doing it to you.  You
                         should be happy that I'm leaving
                         you alone for once.

                         No, this is a new low for you! 
                         You're messing with my family and
                         that's not cool!

                         I think your family is messed up
                         enough already.

                                   MEG
                         If you want to pick on me,
                         whatever.  But you leave my brother
                         alone!  Now I'm gonna have to be
                         the one to tell him what you've
                         done!  And he's gonna be hurt from
                         what I say, when you're the one
                         that did it!

                                   CONNIE
                         You think he'll believe you?  Meg,
                         nobody listens to anything you say. 
                         Why would your brother be any
                         different?  He's obviously
                         clueless.

                                   MEG
                         Connie, I've been wanting to do
                         this for a long time.  You've never
                         ached me enough to do it, but this
                         is the worst crap you've ever done,
                         and I think you deserve it!

               Meg swings her fist, and Connie ducks.

               Connie swings back, and her fist strikes Meg across the
               cheek.  Meg is knocked back against a test tube rack, and
               shattered glass showers over the floor.

               Meg is furious.  She grabs a broken piece of glass and swings
               it at Connie, trying to slice her.  The glass cuts Connie's
               arm.

               Connie retorts with a swing of a science book.  The book hits
               Meg in the forehead.

               Meg grabs Connie by the hair and bashes her head against a
               student desk, faster and faster, harder and harder.

               Connie swings her feet from behind, kicking Meg in the chest. 
               Meg falls on the floor.  Connie pounces on her like a tiger.

               Meg punches Connie in the stomach.

               Connie picks Meg up from the floor and lifts her head towards
               the twirling ceiling fan.  The blades of the fan knock Meg in
               the head.

               Meg grabs a fan blade, yanking it from the ceiling fan.  She
               swings the fan blade at Connie, knocking her repeatedly
               across the face.

               The two both fall to the floor, tired and bruised, breathing
               heavy.

                         back at her ex boyfriend!  Not
                         because she likes him!

                         It's not true!

                         Meg, why would you think that?

                                   MEG
                         Mom, she told me today!  That's why
                         I swung at her!  I don't want Chris
                         to be hurt, and if he stays with
                         her, he will be!

                         right to punch a girl!  You were
                         taught not to!

                         nonsense.  Meg, personal matters
                         are not to be dealt with at school. 
                         I am still suspending you for the

               Meg, Peter, and Lois exit the room.

               Principal Shepherd looks at Connie.

               Principal Shepherd licks his lips and winks.  

               Connie stares blankly.

               Stewie is standing on the couch with a laser gun pointed at
               the floor.

               Brian enters the room.

                         Stewie, what the hell are you

                         Waiting, Brian.  I might suggest
                         you climb to higher ground if you
                         want stay alive.

                         what I am!

                         Stewie, you're two feet off of the
                         ground.  That's not gonna protect
                         you if another earthquake does
                         come.

                         method of staying off of the floor!

               Stewie grabs two stilts and motions towards the stairs.  He
               climbs up them, disappearing on the second floor.

               Peter, Meg, and Lois enter the house.

               Stewie is making a flying machine which looks strikingly
               similar to a high-tech flying saucer.

                                   STEWIE
                         At last!  My flying device is now
                         completed!

               Stewie steps inside the flying device and activates the
               controls.  The machine lifts up from the ground.

                                   STEWIE
                         No floor will get me up here!

               He remains in the air, bobbing up and down with the machine. 
               He becomes excited with the vibration.  He unzips his
               overalls.

               Stewie sees a JUMANJI game dangling off of the edge of the
               large crack in the floor.  He moves the machine down, quickly
               grabbing it.

               He suddenly notices RUPERT, his beloved gay Teddy Bear,
               dangling off of the edge of the crack as well.

               Stewie jumps out of his machine, falling into the crack and
               grabbing Rupert before he falls.
